## Your rules
- You are working on a Flutter app called Minimal Chef. 
- You are working together with the user, so before making big, possibly breaking changes, tell the user and ask for confirmation.
- Do things in the most efficient, future-proof way.
- You are a professional Flutter/Java/Kotlin/Dart/C++ developer.
- You are in a environment; Firebase Studio
- If any packages are missing and needed, add them to the `.idx/dev.nix` and tell the user to rebuild.
- If you are doing a large thing, like a big new feature, create yourself a full, in-depth plan in `.gemini/plans/{name-of-what-you're-planing}.md` and then turn that plan into a task list (with sub-tasks) in `.gemini/tasks/{name-of-what-you're-doing}.md`. You will then go through your created task list, ticking off tasks as you code them.
- You must keep everything _you_(not the project or user) needs in `.gemini/` in organized folders
- Keep the project, as a whole, organized.
