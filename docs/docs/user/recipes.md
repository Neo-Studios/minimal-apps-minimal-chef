The heart of Zest is its recipe collection. Here's how to manage and use recipes in the app.

## Finding Recipes

You can find recipes in a few different ways:

*   **Browse:** The main screen of the app shows a list of all available recipes. You can scroll through this list to discover new ideas.
*   **Search:** Use the search bar at the top of the screen to find recipes by name or ingredient.
*   **Filter:** You can filter the recipe list by cuisine and difficulty to narrow down your options.

## Recipe Details

When you tap on a recipe, you'll see its detail screen. This screen includes:

*   The recipe's name and a photo.
*   The prep time, cook time, and number of servings.
*   A list of ingredients with their quantities.
*   Step-by-step instructions for preparing the dish.

## Favorites

To save a recipe for later, you can mark it as a favorite. Tap the heart icon at the top of the recipe detail screen to add it to your favorites. You can view all of your favorite recipes in the "Favorites" tab.

## Rating

After you've tried a recipe, you can give it a rating to help other users and to remember your own experience. On the recipe detail screen, tap on the stars to select a rating from 1 to 5.
