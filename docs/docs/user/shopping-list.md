The shopping list feature helps you keep track of the ingredients you need to buy for your planned meals.

## Generating a Shopping List

You can generate a shopping list from your meal plan or from a single recipe.

* **From your meal plan:** Go to the "Meal Plan" tab and tap the "Generate Shopping List" button. This will create a shopping list with all the ingredients you need for the week's meals.
* **From a recipe:** On the recipe detail screen, tap the "Add to Shopping List" button. This will add the ingredients for that recipe to your shopping list.

## Managing Your Shopping List

You can view and manage your shopping list by tapping on the "Shopping List" tab. Here, you can:

* Check off items as you buy them.
* Add your own items to the list.
* Remove items from the list.
* Clear the entire list.
