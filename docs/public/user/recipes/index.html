        <p>The heart of Zest is its recipe collection. Here&rsquo;s how to manage and use recipes in the app.</p>
<h2 id="finding-recipes">Finding Recipes</h2>
<p>You can find recipes in a few different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Browse:</strong> The main screen of the app shows a list of all available recipes. You can scroll through this list to discover new ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Search:</strong> Use the search bar at the top of the screen to find recipes by name or ingredient.</li>
<li><strong>Filter:</strong> You can filter the recipe list by cuisine and difficulty to narrow down your options.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recipe-details">Recipe Details</h2>
<p>When you tap on a recipe, you&rsquo;ll see its detail screen. This screen includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The recipe&rsquo;s name and a photo.</li>
<li>The prep time, cook time, and number of servings.</li>
<li>A list of ingredients with their quantities.</li>
<li>Step-by-step instructions for preparing the dish.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="favorites">Favorites</h2>
<p>To save a recipe for later, you can mark it as a favorite. Tap the heart icon at the top of the recipe detail screen to add it to your favorites. You can view all of your favorite recipes in the &ldquo;Favorites&rdquo; tab.</p>
<h2 id="rating">Rating</h2>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve tried a recipe, you can give it a rating to help other users and to remember your own experience. On the recipe detail screen, tap on the stars to select a rating from 1 to 5.</p>
